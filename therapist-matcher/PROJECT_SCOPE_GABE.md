## Executive Summary

ACT Coaching For Life is a comprehensive coaching platform designed to connect individuals seeking life coaching services with qualified coaches. The platform operates similarly to BetterHelp.com, providing an automated matching system, appointment scheduling, and communication tools. The system is structured as a multi-dashboard application with separate interfaces for members, coaches, and administrators.

## Project Overview

### Core Mission
To create a seamless platform that connects individuals with relationship issues, work-related challenges, family problems, and other life coaching needs with the most suitable coaches through an intelligent matching algorithm.

### Key Differentiators
- **Terminology Compliance:** All references use "coaches" instead of "therapists" to comply with regulatory requirements
- **Intelligent Matching:** Automated algorithm-based coach-patient matching
- **Multi-Dashboard Architecture:** Separate, specialized interfaces for different user types
- **Integrated Communication:** Built-in messaging system for coach-client communication
- **Video Integration:** VideoSDK integration for virtual sessions
